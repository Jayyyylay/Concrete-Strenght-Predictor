# Concrete-Strenght-Predictor
**Domain** : Material manufacturing

**Description**: The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).

**Objective** : Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using Machine Learning
